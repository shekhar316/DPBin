DPBin is an efficient waste management system is necessary and a crucial step towards saving the environment and ensuring a healthy surroundings. It is a simulation based novel method for calculating the priority of dustbins dynamically based on various factors like filled level of dustbin, odour level in the surroundings,importance of location, garbage generation rate, and days sincelast service.
